            <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[25] is a country in South Asia. It is
                the
                seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in
                the
                world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
                on
                the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
                north;
                and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and
                the
                Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and
                Indonesia.The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and
                cultural diversity.[108] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to
                647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[109] When
                his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[109] When the
                Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in
                turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[109] No ruler of this period
                was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[108] During
                this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural
                economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[110] The
                caste system consequently began to show regional differences.
