    <h1 style="font-size: 80px;">Types of CSS: Inline, External and Internal</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The main difference between inline CSS and external CSS is that inline CSS is processed
        faster as it only
        requires the browser to download 1 file while using external CSS will require downloading HTML and CSS files
        separately.

        In this tutorial, we’ll go in depth comparing the three types of CSS styles: inline, external, and internal.
        We’ll also uncover the advantages and disadvantages of using each method.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size: 80px;">What Exactly Is CSS?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language responsible for how your web pages
        will look like. It controls
        the colors, fonts, and layouts of your website elements.

        This style sheet language also allows you to add effects or animations to your website. You can use it to
        display some CSS animations like click button effects, spinners or loaders, and animated backgrounds.

        Without CSS, your website will appear as a plain HTML page.</p>

<pre>Internal or embedded ⁠— add style tag in the head section of HTML document
External ⁠— link the HTML sheet to a separate .css file
Inline ⁠— apply CSS rules for specific elements.
