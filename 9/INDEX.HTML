    <h1>Pseudo-classes</h1>
</body>
<p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.</p>
<p>A pseudo-class consists of a colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., :hover). A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parenthesis to define the arguments (e.g., :dir()). The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an anchor element (e.g., button in case button:hover).

    Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (:visited, for example), the status of its content (like :checked on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like :hover, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">For further information</a></p>
